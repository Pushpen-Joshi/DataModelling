# DataModelling

## Project Summary

The project goal was to build a Postgres schema with the tables designed to optimize queries on pizza orders analysis.
This is very simple but crucial project to understand how the databases are built and get understanding of psycopg2 and pandas library in Python.

A simple data model representation was built on diagrams.net(formally draw.io) which is a free and open source cross-platform graph drawing software.


## Project dataset

The dataset is a year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.It was procured from Kaggle.com which allows users to find and publish data sets, explore and build models.
